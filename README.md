# FINALE

FINALE is a lightweight WebApp to view [LabVIEW](https://www.ni.com/en-in/shop/labview.html) code. FINALE stands for FINALE Is Not A LabVIEW Editor.

This solves many use cases like:
  - Code sharing: Sharing LabVIEW code with a person who does not have LabVIEW installed.
  - Viewing LabVIEW code without launching LabVIEW.
  - Viewing LabVIEW code saved in incompatible version.
  - Viewing LabVIEW code that is being used with TestStand.

# Features

  - A left pane to display project hierarchy.
  - Search functionality to find things of interest quickly.
  - Support for viewing the following file types:
    - VI
    - CTL
    - LVClass
    - LLB
    - LVProj
    - Polymorphic VI
  - Support for viewing Multi Frame Structures like:
    - Case Structures
    - Event Structures
    - Diagram Disable Structures
    - Stacked Sequence Structures
  - Navigation to SubVIs and Dynamic Dispatch SubVIs.

Note: FINALE is not supported by National Instruments and this is mostly internal tooling that we are exposing. This is a work in progress, and is not yet feature complete.

# Setting up FINALE for your code

FINALE has two parts, the HTML Generator and the WebApp. The HTML Generator converts LabVIEW code to metadata in the form of JSONs, images etc. These are input to the WebApp which opens a web-based viewer for the files converted. 
## Prerequisites: 
- LabVIEW: Required only for converting the files.
- Browser: Google Chrome/Firefox (Does not have complete support in Edge)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
>Note: If there are errors with the npm http-server, try installing at this version:
>
>`npm install â€“g http-server@0.9.0`

The WebApp is developed using NPM. Run the following commands to produce binaries under a "build" directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ni/finale && cd finale
npm install
npm run build-webapp
```

## Running FINALE:
Follow these instructions to run FINALE:
- Once you have the repository built and set up according to the above commands, proceed to the next step.

- ### Converting LabVIEW code to JSON: 
   - Navigate to "buid/HTMLGenerator/".

   - Open Main.vi and enter values for the following:
     - Source directory/files: Path to the source LabVIEW code file(s) or folder.
     - Destination Directory: Path to the destination directory. To view the files using the WebApp, make sure your destination is set to "<Path/to/FINALE/repo>/build/src".
     - Run Main.vi and click "Convert".

     > Note: If you require certain files/projects to be preloaded for converting  the files, open GeneratorUI-Advanced.vi and enter values for the following:
     >  - Top level output path: <Path/to/FINALE/repo>/build/src
     >  - Files to Preload: Array of files you want to preload. If this is  left empty it is equivalent to running Main.vi.
     >  - File(s)/Folder to convert: Path to the source LabVIEW code file(s) or  folders.
     >  - Destination Folder (relative to output path): This is an optional  field to specify an output path for the converted files. This must  be relative to the Top level output path.

- ### Using the WebApp:
  The WebApp reads the FINALE format stored in the "build" directory. To launch the WebApp:
  - On cmd or PowerShell, navigate to the "build" directory in the repo and start the npm http-server:
  >`http-server [-p PORTNUMBER]`
  - The above command launches the server at the displayed address where the FINALE format files can be viewed.
  - FINALE should now be ready to use!
  - #### Adding more converted files
    If more converted files/folders need to be added at this point,
    - Convert the new projects to a different location using Main.vi. (Main.vi first deletes the destination directory.)
    - Copy these FINALE format files "<Path/to/FINALE/repo>/build/src". Make sure to rename the new file.json so that the existing file.json does not get replaced.
    - Create a config.txt file that lists these .json files. The paths should be relative to the root of the server, that is, the "build" directory.
      For example, if their are 3 FINALE format files (foo + foo.json), (bar + bar.json) and (baz + baz.json), and "foo" and "bar" need to be viewed, config.txt should list these .json files like so:
    ```sh
      /src/foo.json
      /src/bar.json
    ```
