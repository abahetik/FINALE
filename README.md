# FINALE

FINALE is a lightweight WebApp to view [LabVIEW](https://www.ni.com/en-in/shop/labview.html) code. FINALE stands for FINALE Is Not A LabVIEW Editor.

This solves many use cases like:
  - Code sharing: Sharing LabVIEW code with a person who does not have LabVIEW installed.
  - Viewing LabVIEW code without launching LabVIEW.
  - Viewing LabVIEW code saved in incompatible version.
  - Viewing LabVIEW code that is being used with TestStand.

# Features

  - A left pane to display project hierarchy.
  - Search functionality to find things of interest quickly.
  - Support for viewing the following file types:
    - VI
    - CTL
    - LVClass
    - LLB
    - LVProj
    - Polymorphic VI
  - Support for viewing Multi Frame Structures like:
    - Case Structures
    - Event Structures
    - Diagram Disable Structures
    - Stacked Sequence Structures
  - Navigation to SubVIs and Dynamic Dispatch SubVIs.

Note: FINALE is not supported by National Instruments and this is mostly internal tooling that we are exposing. This is a work in progress, and is not yet feature complete.

# Setting up FINALE for your code

FINALE has two parts, the HTML Generator and the WebApp.The HTML Generator converts LabVIEW code to a FINALE format (a composition of JSON documents, images, etc., which is understood by the WebApp). These are input to the WebApp which opens a web-based viewer for the files converted. 
## Prerequisites: 
- LabVIEW: Required only for converting the files.
- Browser: Google Chrome/Firefox (Does not have complete support in Edge)
- Python 3+ : For CLI tool.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
>Note: If there are errors with the npm http-server, try installing at this version:
>
>`npm install â€“g http-server@0.9.0`

The WebApp is developed using NPM. Run the following commands to produce binaries under a "build" directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ni/finale && cd finale
npm install
npm run build-webapp
```

## Running FINALE:
Follow these instructions to run FINALE:
- Once you have the repository built and set up according to the above commands, proceed to the next step.

- ### Converting LabVIEW code to FINALE format
  This can be done in two ways:

    - #### Running the Converter VI: 
      - Navigate to "buid/HTMLGenerator/".

      - Open Main.vi and enter values for the following:
        - Source directory/files: Path to the source LabVIEW code file(s) or folder.
        - Destination Directory: Path to the destination directory. To view the files using the WebApp, make sure your destination is set to "<Path/to/FINALE/repo>/build/src".
        - Run Main.vi and click "Convert".
      ![Main.vi](./docs/Main.vi.png)
        > Note: If you require certain files/projects to be preloaded for converting  the files, open GeneratorUI-Advanced.vi and enter values for the following:
        >  - Top level output path: <Path/to/FINALE/repo>/build/src
        >  - Files to Preload: Array of files you want to preload. If this is  left empty it is equivalent to running Main.vi.
        >  - File(s)/Folder to convert: Path to the source LabVIEW code file(s) or  folders.
        >  - Destination Folder (relative to output path): This is an optional  field to specify an output path for the converted files. This must  be relative to the Top level output path.

    - #### Using CLI:
      - On cmd or powershell, navigate to <Path/of/FINALE/repo>/build/HTMLGenerator.
      - Run command:
      > `python -c "import converter; converter.convert_from_JSON('<Absolute/Path/For/JSON/file>')"`
      - The JSON file mentioned above should be of the structure:
        ```json
          {
          "topPath": <"Absolute Path where you want the FINALE format to be stored">,
          "configurations": [
            {
                "inputPath": <"Absolute Path of the source files/directory that needs to be converted">,
                "outputPath": <"Relative Path to <topPath> so that the output of the converter can be redirected to this path instead of the topPath">,
                "preloadFiles": "File/Project that need to be preloaded to load up the actual files, that need to be converted"
            },
            {
                "inputPath": "...",
                "outputPath": "...",
                "preloadFiles": "..."
            },
              ...
            ]
          }
        ```
      >  - Note: "configurations" takes project values for multiple project conversion.
      >  - Only "inputPath" is a mandatory key in the "configurations". The other keys like "outputPath" and "preloadFiles" can be used when converting multiple projects.
      >  - May need to install PathLib module (https://pypi.org/project/pathlib/)


- ### Launching the WebApp:
   - On cmd or powershell, navigate to the "build" directory in the repo and start the npm http-server:
   >`http-server` 
   - The above command will list the converted files in the project hierarchy on the left pane.
   - FINALE should now be ready to use!
